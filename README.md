# CapturePointWalkingRobot

This is an addition to the walking robot project I have done in the past with Sebastian in MATLAB and Simulink Robotics Arena. https://github.com/mathworks/msra-walking-robot

This one deals with the Capture Point Algorithm described in Englsberger's 'Bipedal walking control based on Capture Point Dynamics'. Please go through 2 livescript files: AnimateCapturePoint and TransformTrajectory to understand the algorithm and codes in Simulink Model.
